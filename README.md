# Mall_Customer_Segmentation 📊
Overview 📝
This project applies unsupervised learning techniques to segment mall customers based on their income, spending habits, and demographics. The goal is to identify distinct customer groups to enable personalized marketing strategies and actionable insights.

Key Features 🚀'

🔧 Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and normalized data using StandardScaler.

📈 Clustering: Implemented K-Means Clustering for customer segmentation.

🎨 Visualization:

Static visualizations using Seaborn (heatmaps, pair plots).

Interactive visualizations with Plotly (3D scatter plots).

📊 Evaluation: Measured cluster quality using the Silhouette Score.

Dataset 📂

The dataset contains 200 entries of mall customers with the following features:

🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Gender
📅 Age
💵 Annual Income (k$)
🛍️ Spending Score (1-100)
Dataset Source: Kaggle

Libraries Used 📚

Data Manipulation: pandas, numpy

Visualization: matplotlib, seaborn, plotly

Machine Learning: scikit-learn

Key Results 🏆

Identified distinct customer segments, such as high spenders and cost-conscious buyers.

Interactive and static visualizations provide clear insights into customer group behavior.

Future Work 🔮

Explore additional clustering algorithms like DBSCAN and Gaussian Mixture Models.

Integrate dimensionality reduction techniques (e.g., PCA, t-SNE).

Develop predictive models for customer behavior.
